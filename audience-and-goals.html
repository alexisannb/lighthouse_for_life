						The people who Lighthouse For Life aim to help are those who are victims of human trafficking, so all who are involved in the business of human trafficking are included as the organization's audience.
						The remaining audience for Lighthouse For Life is broad, because one of their main goals is to educate as many people as possible about the realities of human trafficking.
						However, there are particular groups of people whose awareness is of special importance, such as law enforcement, prosecutors, and any workers in the community who may have increased chances of encountering human trafficking activity.
						Local businesses, churches, and agencies are included because they are potential partners and sponsors for the organization.
						Additionally, youth, teens, parents, and schools are important audiences to educate about human trafficking.
						Potential volunteers are named as well, which can include anyone, although college students are a likely audience.
