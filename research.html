						There are endless news updates on the relevance and horror of human trafficking in the world, but there are also continual breakthroughs in the fight against it.
					</p>
						<p>Beginning August 29, 2020, 13 countries have banded together in competition to innovate strategies to track human trafficking in order to prevent it. They are working to develop tools that utilize technologies and data analysis towards the end of human trafficking.
						Each team will present their proposal for solutions at the closing of the competition.
						This is an online event called "DataJam Pasos Libres" and is organized by IBM and Pasos Libres.
					</p>
						<p>This effort has faced challenges because of the complexity of the data, the lack of information, and the difficulty of turning knowledge into practical solutions.
						Joining in the fight against human trafficking is one way these individuals and companies are using their resources, knowledge and technologies to do good.

					The UNODC partnered with Brazil this year for a 'Freedom in the Air' Initiative in which airline staff and passengers are educated about human trafficking. This empowers people to understand the signs and tactics of human trafficking and take appropriate action.
					This initiative consists of multilingual materials that explains the reality of sexual and labor exploitation and provides ways to intervene.
					The 'Freedom in the Air' Initiative is a helpful implementation of human trafficking prevention in an environment that crosses paths with traffickers and victims often.

						Anti-Slavery is an international organization that works to fight against human trafficking.
						Their website is organized more succinctly than the website for Lighthouse For Life, with fewer tabs at the top of the page.
						The black, white, and red color palette has a powerful visual impact while maintaining negative space on the page.
						I would like to design my website for Lighthouse for Life with even less information on the home page, but the increased visual simplicity of Anti-Slavery.org provides a helpful stepping stone for my website redesign.

						The Polaris Project website is the most successfully designed website about human trafficking I have seen.
						The hierarchy is clear, the visual noise is beautifully reduced, the information is succinct and approachable, and the navigation is simple and organized.
						Responsive design is incorporated throughout the site in hover buttons and linked icons.
						The visual tone of imagery is consistent. Not only is the copy throughout the site concise, but content is often accompanied with visuals such as diagrams, images, or charts.
						Perhaps most of all, I appreciate the clear delineation between information about human trafficking, the work of the organization, and the opportunities for the website user to take action.
						I would like to incorporate these design strategies into the Lighthouse For Life website so that communication is clear and effective.

						<p class="info">Interview with the CEO of Lighthouse for Life.</p>
					</header>
					<div>
						<img src="images/jen.webp" alt="Jen Thompson" />
					</div>
						<br>
						<p><b>Jen Thompson</b> is the CEO of Lighthouse for Life. As the CEO, she oversees the overall vision and direction of the ministry while strengthening partnerships and engaging the community. From my discussion with Jen, I gained an understanding of the goals of Lighthouse for Life as an organization and for their online platform. Their overarching business objective is to “reach as many people as possible with as much information as possible about human trafficking,” specifically in the United States, and more specifically in South Carolina. Lighthouse for Life also aims to distinguish myth from fact in regards to human trafficking. Their final main objective is to share the agency’s story and spread knowledge of the work they are doing, so that they can provide assistance for those leaving the life of trafficking. This assistance is provided primarily through the shelter they operate.
						</p>
						<p>Thompson explained that their assistance and response as an organization is as diverse as the requests they get from the community. They aim to be a network for people, in which everyone is educated on the subject of human trafficking, those who are seeking freedom have a shelter to begin healing, and resources are provided for all people in their community.
						</p>
						<p>Jen Thompson understands that the organization’s website is “a living, breathing thing,” in which information has to be updated and communication strategies are shaped over time. She views their website as a place for the static, controlled narrative of Lighthouse for Life, where information about the organization, updates on events, and facts about human trafficking are all available in a “one-stop shop.” Jen understands that in order for people to support the organization, they have to believe that there is a need. Therefore, awareness about the reality of human trafficking is a predominant aspect of their website.
						</p>
						<p>Examples of website users Thompson offered include people who have recently moved to the area of Columbia and want to discover local organizations, sponsors who are looking to see if they are represented on the site, or people who are looking for an introduction to the organization. The website users also include those who want to get involved somehow. They may be interested in volunteering with Lighthouse for Life or donating to the cause. Additionally, Thompson knows that many of the website’s users desire resources and information about human trafficking in South Carolina and beyond.</p>
						<p>My interview with Jen helped me to understand their priorities and motivations as an organization, which helps me comprehend how to best design the layout of the website. If their main goals are awareness about human trafficking and their organization, I can divide my website clearly into these two categories. Then, I can navigate users through the site based on what is most important. For example, I may display information about human trafficking as primary, and use that to guide the user to information about Lighthouse for Life, rather than having information about both mixed together throughout the site. Further, information about volunteering or donating may be strategically placed based on when the website user might feel most compelled to help.

					<p class="info">Interview with John Boyte.</p>
				</header>
				<p><b>John Boyte</b> is currently the pastor of Living Hope Church in Anderson, SC and the RUF Campus Minister at Anderson University. In these roles, John Boyte is a good representation of someone who is in my website’s primary user group. In visiting the website for Lighthouse for Life, John would first want to know more about the organization and their approach to helping human trafficking victims. He had questions like, “What part does the Gospel play in their recovery?, “What is the recovery like long-term?”, and “What methods do they use?”. </p>

<p>He would then look for clarity regarding how his church and how volunteers can play a role in helping the organization. If one of those ways to help is donating financially, John would want to see on the website exactly where funds are going towards. Ultimately, he is looking to discern whether the organization’s priorities and values match up with his own. He would be stirred to give financially if monthly giving was tied to a specific accomplishment, rather than a general fund. If volunteering is another way to help, John would want to know exactly how volunteers are involved with the organization. </p>

<p>In my interview with John Boyte, I gained an understanding that the website needs to include detailed information about the work Lighthouse for Life does as well as what to expect as a potential sponsor or volunteer. </p>
