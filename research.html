						There are endless news updates on the relevance and horror of human trafficking in the world, but there are also continual breakthroughs in the fight against it.
					</p>
						<p>Beginning August 29, 2020, 13 countries have banded together in competition to innovate strategies to track human trafficking in order to prevent it. They are working to develop tools that utilize technologies and data analysis towards the end of human trafficking.
						Each team will present their proposal for solutions at the closing of the competition.
						This is an online event called "DataJam Pasos Libres" and is organized by IBM and Pasos Libres.
					</p>
						<p>This effort has faced challenges because of the complexity of the data, the lack of information, and the difficulty of turning knowledge into practical solutions.
						Joining in the fight against human trafficking is one way these individuals and companies are using their resources, knowledge and technologies to do good.

					The UNODC partnered with Brazil this year for a 'Freedom in the Air' Initiative in which airline staff and passengers are educated about human trafficking. This empowers people to understand the signs and tactics of human trafficking and take appropriate action.
					This initiative consists of multilingual materials that explains the reality of sexual and labor exploitation and provides ways to intervene.
					The 'Freedom in the Air' Initiative is a helpful implementation of human trafficking prevention in an environment that crosses paths with traffickers and victims often.

						Anti-Slavery is an international organization that works to fight against human trafficking.
						Their website is organized more succinctly than the website for Lighthouse For Life, with fewer tabs at the top of the page.
						The black, white, and red color palette has a powerful visual impact while maintaining negative space on the page.
						I would like to design my website for Lighthouse for Life with even less information on the home page, but the increased visual simplicity of Anti-Slavery.org provides a helpful stepping stone for my website redesign.

						The Polaris Project website is the most successfully designed website about human trafficking I have seen.
						The hierarchy is clear, the visual noise is beautifully reduced, the information is succinct and approachable, and the navigation is simple and organized.
						Responsive design is incorporated throughout the site in hover buttons and linked icons.
						The visual tone of imagery is consistent. Not only is the copy throughout the site concise, but content is often accompanied with visuals such as diagrams, images, or charts.
						Perhaps most of all, I appreciate the clear delineation between information about human trafficking, the work of the organization, and the opportunities for the website user to take action.
						I would like to incorporate these design strategies into the Lighthouse For Life website so that communication is clear and effective.
